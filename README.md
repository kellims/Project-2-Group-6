### Our Story

Founded in 2023 by a group of food enthusiasts: Mustafa Cevik, Dolores Crazover and Kelli Simon. KitchenConnect was born out of a desire to make the world of cooking more accessible and enjoyable. We noticed that the process of finding and trying new recipes was often complicated, with many websites offering inconsistent and untested recipes. We wanted to change that and create a one-stop platform that combines a powerful search engine with a friendly and supportive community of cooks.

#### How it works - User flow

- 1. As a user, I want to be introduced to the KitchenConnect platform when I arrive at the homepage, because I want to learn about the platform and its features before I start exploring.
- 2. As a user, I want to be able to browse recipes by category or use the search function to find a specific recipe, because I want to be able to find the recipes that interest me quickly and easily.
- 3. As a user, I want to be able to view the details of a recipe, including ingredients, instructions, cooking time, and nutritional information, because I want to make informed decisions about which recipes to try.
- 4. As a user, I want to be able to create recipes to the list of recipes by clicking the "Save" button, because I want to be able to quickly find and access the list of recipes.
- 5. As a user, I want to be able to delete recipes from list of recipes by clicking the "Delete" button next to the recipe, because I want to be able to manage my list easily.
- 6. As a user, I want to be able to contribute to the KitchenConnect community by adding my own recipe or editing an existing recipe I've tried because I want to share my own knowledge and experience with others on the platform.
