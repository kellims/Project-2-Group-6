# About KitchenConnect

KitchenConnect is a platform that connects people through the love of cooking and sharing recipes. Our mission is to make it easy for everyone, from beginners to seasoned chefs, to find, create, edit, share, and rate recipes, as well as connect with others who share their passion for cooking.

## Our Story

Founded in 2023 by a group of food enthusiasts: Mustafa Cevik, Dolores Crazover and Kelli Simon. KitchenConnect was born out of a desire to make the world of cooking more accessible and enjoyable. We noticed that the process of finding and trying new recipes was often complicated, with many websites offering inconsistent and untested recipes. We wanted to change that and create a one-stop platform that combines a powerful search engine with a friendly and supportive community of cooks.
